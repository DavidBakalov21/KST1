    Communication protocol description
Let’s start from the implementation of send/receive message logic for text.
Send message mechanic is created by:
1.  sending 4 bytes(size of int, checked in the app) as the size of the message itself. So on the other side the appropriate buffer was created.
2.message itself is sent.
3. data  and received and stored in the created buffer and can be accessed.

For files it is mostly the same, however because of streamsize type is used we are sending not 4 bytes , but 8 (size of streamsize) 

based on this mechanism all commands can be described 
get command:
1.client sends command to server 
2. client sends name to server 
3.server sends file’s size 
4.server sends file from the “database folder”
5. client receives file size
6.client receives file data from server

list command:
client sends command to server
server sends each file name one by one
client receives names one by one
When there are no names remain, server sends “End” in order to stop client from listening in loop

put command:
1.client sends command to server 
2. client sends name to server 
3.client sends file’s size
4 client sends file’s data from client folder
after server received file it sends confirmation message(“Confirm”) to client

delete command:
1.client sends command to server 
2. client sends name to server 
3.server deletes file and sends confirmation to client


info command:
1.client sends command to server 
2. client sends name to server 
3.server sends size
4. server sends last modification time

q command:
1.client sends command to server 
2. server shuts down
3. client shuts down
